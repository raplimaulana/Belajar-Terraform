### REPLACING RESOURCES ###
When resources has become damaged or degraded that cannot be detected by terraform, we can use -replace flag.

##terraform taint
Terraform taint is used to mark a resource for replacement, next time you ru apply.
Why would want to mark resource for replacement?
A cloud resource can become degraded or damaged and you want to return expected resource to a healthy state.

terraform taint aws_instance.my_web.app 

##terraform replace 
Terraform taint was deprecated in 0.152.
It is recomended in 0.152+ to use -replace flag and providing a resource address.

terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.example[0]"
