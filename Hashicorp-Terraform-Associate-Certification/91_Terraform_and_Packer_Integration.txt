### TERRAFORM AND PACKER INTEGRATION ###
1. Building image 
   Packer is not a service but a development tool so you need to manually run packer or automate building of image with a build server running packer.

2. Referencing Image 
   Once an image is built you can reference image as a data source.
   e.g. for AWS AMI we can ask it to match on regex and to select most recent.

   data "aws_ami" "example" {
     executable_users = ["self"]
     most_recent      = true
     name_regex       = "^myami-\\d{3}"
     owners           = ["self"]
   }
