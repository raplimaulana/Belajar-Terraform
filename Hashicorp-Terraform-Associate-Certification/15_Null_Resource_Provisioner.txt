### NULL RESOURECE ###
Null resource is a placeholder for resources that have no specific association to a provider resources.
You can provide a connection an triggers to a resource.
Triggers is a map values which should cause this set provisioners to re-run.
Values are meant to be interpolated references to variables or attributes of other resources.

##Example
resource "aws_instance" "cluster" {
  count = 3
  ...
}

resource "null_resource" "cluster" {
  triggers = {
    cluster_instance_ids = "${join(",", aws_instance.cluster*.id)}                      #change to any instance of the cluster requires re-provisioning
  }

  connection {
    host = "${element(aws_instance.cluster*.public_ip, 0)}"                             #bootstrap script can run on any instance of the cluster, so we just choose the first in this case 
  }

  provisioner {
    inline = [
        "bootstrap-cluster.sh ${join(" ", aws_instance.cluster*.private_ip)}"           #boostrep script called with private_ip of each node in the cluster 
    ]
  }
}


#Examplee null_resource 2
resource "null_resource" "status" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws ec2 wait instance-status-pok --instance-ids ${aws_instance.my_server.id}"
  }
  depends_on = [
    aws_instance.my_server
  ]
}
