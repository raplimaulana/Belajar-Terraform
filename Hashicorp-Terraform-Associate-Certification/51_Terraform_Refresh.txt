### TERRAFORM REFRESH ###
Terraform refresh command reads current setting from all managed remote objects and updates terraform state to match.
When an approved manual configuration of a resources has changed or removed, we use -refresh-only flag to detect changes in our state file.
Terrform refresh will not modify your real remote objects, but it will modifiy terraform state.
Terraform refresh command is an alias for refresh only and auto approve.

terraform refresh = terraform apply -refresh-only - auto-approve

*terraform refresh has been deprecated and with refresh-only flag, it was not safe since it did not give you and opportunity to review changes before updating state file.


##Terraform refresh-only mode 
-refresh-only flag for terraform plan or apply allows you to refresh and update your state file without making changes to your remote infrastucture.

Imagine you create terraform scripts that deploys a VM on AWS, you ask an engineer to terminate the server. 
Instead of updating terraform script, they mistakenly terminate the server via AWS Console.

- terraform apply
  If state file is correct, change infrastucture to match state file.
  Terraform will notie that VM is missing.
  Terraform will propose to create new VM.

- terraform apply -refresh-only 
  If state file is wrong, change state file to match infrastucture.
  Terraform will notie that VM is missing.
  With -refresh-only page, that missing VM is intentional.
  Terraform will propose to delete VM on state file.
