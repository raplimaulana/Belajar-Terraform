### TERRAFORM AND VAULT ###
When a developer is working with terraform and they need to deploy provider e.g. AWS, they will need AWS credential.
AWS credential are long-lived, meaning a user generate key and secret and they are usable until they are deleted.
AWS credential reside on developer's local machine.
That machine is at risk of being compromised by a malicious actors looking to steal credential.
If we could provide credential Just-in-Time (JIT) and expire credential after a short amount of time (short-lived), we can reduce attack surface area of local machine.
Vault can be used to inject short-lived secret at time of terraform apply.
