• Terraform registry with 1000+ providers

##Terraform Cloud
Terraform Cloud is a Software a Services (SaaS) offering for:
• Remote state storage
• Version control integration
• Flexible workflows
• Collaborate on Infrastructure changes in a single inified web portal (www.terraform.io/cloud)

In majority of cases you should be using Terraform Cloud.
The only case where you may not want to use it to manage your state file is your company has many regulatory requirements along with a long procurement process so you could use standard remote backend, Atlantis or investigate Terrafor Enterprise.
Terraform Cloud has a generous free-tier that allows for team collaboration for the first 5 users of your organization.
The underlying software for Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise is known as the "Terraform Platform"
