### DEBUGGING TERRAFORM ###
Terraform has detailed logs which can be enabled by setting TF_LOG environment into:
- TRACE 
- DEBUG 
- INFO
- WARN
- ERROR 
- JSON
  Output logs at TRACE level or higher, and uses a perseable JSON encoding as the formatting.

Logging can be enabled by separatelly, it takes some options as TF_LOG.
- TF_LOG_CORE
- TF_LOG_PROVIDER

You can choose where you want to log with TF_LOG_PATH.

##Command TF_LOG terraform
TF_LOG=TRACE terraform apply
TF_LOG=TRACE TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log terraform apply


##Crash logs
if terraform ever crashes (a "panic" in GO runtime), it saves a log file with debug logs from session as well as panic message and backtrace to crash.log.
This log file is meant to be passed along to developer terraform via github issue.
As user, we're not required to dig into this file.
