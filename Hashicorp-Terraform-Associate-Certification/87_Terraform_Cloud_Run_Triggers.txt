### TERRAFORM CLOUD RUN TRIGGERS ###
Terraform cloud provide a way to connect your workspace to one or more workspaces via run triggers within your organization, know as 'source workspace'.

##Run triggers
Allow run to queue automatically in your workspace on successful apply of run in any of source workspace.
You can connect each workspace to up 20 source workspace.

Run trigger are designed for workspace that rely on information or infrastructure produced by other workspace.
If a terraform configuration use data source to read value that might be changed by another workspace, run triggers let you explicitly specify that external dependency.
