### EXECUTION PLANS ###
Execution plans is a manual review of what will add, change or destroy before you apply changes.
$ terraform apply

#Example output terraform apply
terraform apply

Terrform used to the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + Create 

Terraform will perform the following actions"
   # aws_instance.app_server will be created
   + resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
       + ami                            = "ami-830c94e3"            #resources and configuration will be listed
       + arn                            = (known after apply)
       + associate_public_ip_address    = (known after apply)
       + avaibility_zone                = (known after apply)
       + cpu_core_count                 = (known after apply)
       + cpu_threads_per_core           = (known after apply)
       + disable_api_termination        = (known after apply)
       + ebs_optimized                  = (known after apply)
       + get_password_data              = false
   ...
   }
   
   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy                        #It will indicate will will be added, changed or destroyed if this plan is approved

   Do you want to perform these actions?
     Terraform will perform the actions described above,
     Only "yes" will be accepted to approve.

     Enter a value: yes                                             #A user must approve changes by typing "yes" 

##Visualizing Execution Plans 
You can visuallize an execution plan as a graph using the terraform graph command.
Terraform will output a GraphViz file (you'll need GraphViz installed to view the file).
GraphViz is a open source tools for drawing graphs specified in DOT language script having the file name extension "gv".

Terraform build a dependency graph from the Terraform configurations and walks this graph to generate plans, refresh state and more.
$terraform graph | fot -Tsvg > graph.svg

When you use terraform graph, this is a visual presentation of the dependency graph.
What is sependency graph?
In mathematics is a direted graph representing dependencies of several objects towards each other.

• Resource node []
  Represents a single resource.

• Resource meta-node ()
  Represents a group of resources, but does not represent any actions on its own.

• Provider configuration node <>
  Represent the time to fully configured provider.
