### RESOURCES ###
Resources in configuration file represent infrastructure objects e.g VM, database, storage, virtual network component, etc.
A resource type determines kind of infrastructure object.

• For Example aws_instance is AWS EC2 instance.

  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ami           = "ami-4984y1a"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
  }

• Some resource types provide a special timeout nested block argument that allows you to cutomize how long certain operations are allowed to take before being considered to have failed.

  resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
    ...
    timeouts {
      create = "60m"
      delete = "2h"
    }
  }
