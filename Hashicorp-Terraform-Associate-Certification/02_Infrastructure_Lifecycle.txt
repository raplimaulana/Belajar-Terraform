### INFRASTRUCTURE LIFECYCLE ###
##What is infrastucrure lifecycle 
Infrastructure lifecycle is a number of clearly defined and distinct worj phases which are used by DevOps Enginners to plan, design, build, test, deliver and retire cloud infrastucture.

##Day 0-2 to concept
Day 0-2 is a smplified way to describe phases of an infrastructure lifecycle.
• Day 0 = plan and design.
• Day 1 = develop and iterate.
• Day 3 = go live and maintain.

##How does IaC enhance the infrastucrure lifecycle?
•  Realiability
   IaC makes change idempotent, consistent, repeatable and predictable.
   *Idempotent = no matter how many times you run IaC, you will always end up with the samre state that is expected.

•  Manageability
   - Enable mutation via code.
   - Revised with minimal changes.

•  Sensibility
   Avoid financial and reputational losses to even loss of life when considering government and military dependencies on infrastructure.

##Non-idempotent vs idempotent
•  Non-idempotent
   - When I deploy my Iac config file, it will provision and launch 2 VM.
   - When I update my IaC again and deploy again, I will end up with 2 new VM with total 4 VM.

•  Idempotent
   - When I deploy my Iac config file, it will provision and launch 2 VM.
   - When I update my IaC again and deploy again, I will update the VM if changed by modifying or deleting and creating new VM (still 2 VM).
