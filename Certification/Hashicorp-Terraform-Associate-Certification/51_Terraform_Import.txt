### TERRAFORM IMPORT ###
Terraform import command is used to import existing resource into terraform.
When an approval manual addition of resource needs to be added to our state file, we use import command.

##Terraform import command
#Define placeholder for your imported resource in configuration file.
#You can leave the body blank and fill it in after importing, because it will not be autofilled.

resource "aws_instance" "example {
  #...
}

#Proceed to importing your import file 
terraform import <RESOURCE_ADDRESS> <ID>
terraform import aws_instance.example i-arb237y

*this command can only import one resoure at time
