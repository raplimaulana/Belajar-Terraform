### PROTECTING SENSITIVE DATA ###
Terraform state file can contain sensitive data e.g. long-live AWS credentials and is a possible attack vector for malicious actors.
• Local state 
  When using a local backend, state is stored in plain-text JSON files:
  - You need to be careful you don't share this state file with anyone
  - You need to be careful you don't commit this file to your git repository

• Remote state with terraform cloud
  When using terraform cloud remote backend:
  - That state file is held in memory and is not persisted to disk
  - State file is encrypt at rest
  - State file is encrypt in transit 
  - With terraform enterprise, you have detailed audit logging for tampper evidence

• Remote state with third party storage 
  You can store state with various third party backends.
  You need to carefully review your backends capabilities to determine if will meet your security and compliance requirements.
  Some backends are not by default as secure as they could be.
  For Example with ASW S3 you have to ensure encryption and versioning is turned on, you need a custom trail for data events.
