### LOCAL-EXEC ###
Local-exec allows you to execute local commands after resource is provisioned.
The machine that executing terraform (eg. terraform apply) is where the command will execute.

Local exec allows you to run any arbitary commands on your local machine.
Commonly used to trigger configuration management eg. Ansible, Chef and Puppet.

Alocal environment could be:
• Local Machine 
  Your laptop / workstation.

• Build Server 
  eg. Jenkins, AWS CodeBuild, GCP Cloud Build. 

• Terraform Cloud Run Environment 
  Single use linux VM on terraform cloud.

#Example use case 
After you provision a Vm you need to supply the public IP to a third-party security service to add the VM IP address, and you accompolish this by using locally installed third-party CLI on your build server.

##Local-exec example 
• command (required)
  The command you want to execute.

  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    # ...
    provisioner "local-exec" {
      command = "echo ${self.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"
    }
  }

• working_dir
  Where the command will be executed.
  eg. /user/rapli/home/project.

• interpreter 
  The entry point for the command.
  What local program will run the command
  eg. Bash, Ruby, AWS CLI, PowerShell.

  resource "null_resoure" "example2" {
    provisioner "local-exec" {
      command = "Get-Date > completed.txt"
      interpreter = ["PowerShell", "-Command"]
    }
  }

• environment
  
  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    # ...
    provisioner "local-exec" {
      command = "echo $KEY $SECRET >> credentials.yaml"
      environment = {
        KEY = "X2jC5LPYmG"
        SECRET = "mykTbxiBXZ"
        } 
    }
  }
