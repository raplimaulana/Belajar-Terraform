### WORKSPACE ###
Workspace allow you manage multiple environments of alternate state files e.g. development, production.
Think of workspace as being similiar to havinf different branches in a git repository.
Workspace are technically equivalent to renaming your state file.
In terraform 0.9 used to called workspace as 'environments'.

There are 2 variant of workspace:
- CLI Workspace 
  A way of managing alternate state files (locally or via remote backend).

- Terraform Cloud Workspace 
  Act like completely separate working directories.

By default you already have a single workspace in your local backend called 'default'.
'default' terraform can never be deleted.

Depending if you a local or remote backend changes how state file is stored.
• Local state 
  Terraform stores workspace states in a folder called terraform.tfstate.d.
  In practice individual or very small team will have been know to commit these file to their repositories.
  Using a remote backend instead is recommended when there are multiple collaborators.

• Remote state 
  Workspace file are stored directly in configured backend.
