### CONNECTION ###
A connection block tells a provisioner or resource how to establish a connection.

##Copies the file as root user using ssh  
provisioner "file" {
  source      = "conf/myapp.conf"
  destination = "/etc/myapp.conf

  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = "${var.root_password}"
    host     = "${var.host}"
  }
}

*With ssh you can connect through a bastian host eg:
 - bastian_host
 - bastian_host_key
 - bastian_port
 - bastian_user
 - bastian_password
 - bastian_private_key
 - bastian_certificate

##Copies the file as administrator user using WinRM (Windows Remote Management)
provisioner "file" {
  source      = "conf/myapp.conf"
  destination = "C:/app/myapp.conf

  connection {
    type     = "winrm"
    user     = "administrator"
    password = "${var.root_password}"
    host     = "${var.host}"
  }
}
