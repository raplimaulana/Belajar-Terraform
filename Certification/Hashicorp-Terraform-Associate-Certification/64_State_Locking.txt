### STATE LOCKING ###
Terraform will lock your state for all operations that could write state.
This prevents others from acquiring lock and potentially corrupting your state.

State locking happens automatically on all operations that could write state.
You wan't see any message that is happening if state locking fails.

*terraform does not output when a lock is complete
 however, if acquiring lock is taking longer than expected, terraform will output a status message

##Disable locking 
You can disable state locking for most commands with -lock flag but its not recommended.

##Force unlock 
Terraform has a force unlock command to manually unlock state if unlocking failed.
If you unlock state when someone else is holding lock, it could cause multiple writers.
Force unlock should only be used to unlock your own lock in situation where automatic unlocking failed.

To protect you, force unlock command requires a unique lock ID.
Terraform will outputs this lock ID if unlocking fails.
