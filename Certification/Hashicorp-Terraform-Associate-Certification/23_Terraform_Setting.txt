### TERRAFORM SETTING ###
The special terraform configuration block type eg. terraform {...} is used to configure some behaviors of terraform itself.
In terraform setting we can specify:
• required_version
  Expected version of terraform.

• required_providers
  Providers that will be pull during an terraform init.

• experiments 
  Experimental language features that community can try and provide feedback.

##Example terraform setting 
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      version = ">= 2.7.0"
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
    }
  }
}
